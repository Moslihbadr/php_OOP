## Project: Student Management System

    1 - Define a class called "Student" with the following properties:
        - Student ID
        - Name
        - Age
        - Grade

    2 -Create methods within the "Student" class for the following actions:
        - Set and get methods for each property (e.g., setStudentID(), getStudentID())
        - A method to display the student details (e.g., displayDetails())

    3 - Implement a class called "StudentManager" to manage a collection of students.
        - The "StudentManager" class should have an array property to store the student objects.
        - Include methods to add a student, remove a student, and retrieve the list of students.

    4 - Instantiate the "StudentManager" class and perform the following operations:
        - Add multiple students to the student manager.
        - Remove a student from the student manager.
        - Display the details of all students in the student manager.
